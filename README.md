# ComIT-Project

This is my final project for ComIT. It is a web app meant for inputting, storing, and organizing the user's personal concert-going statistics.

When the project is complete, the user will be able to add, edit, and delete concerts, and view a variety of statistics and information regarding that concert-going data. 

There will be the ability to sort the list of shows chronologically, or view a full master list of all bands (including number of times they've each been seen), as well as generating statistics such as "average length of time between two shows", "average length of time between seeing a particular band", etc.

All bands, cities, and venues will be able to be viewed into individual pages where information can be seen, such as the number of times one has seen a certain band, or been to a certain venue, or gone to concerts in a certain city.

This project is currently under construction and is being made using Javascript, Pug, and MongoDB. Expected completion date is September 2018.
